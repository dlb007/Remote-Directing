    "An example of this directive brings me back to an unintentional but timely research discovery of my own. When I was on my path to finishing up my thesis research and finishing production on capturing my film directives. I had to shift to a new model of film production to finish the film and paper due to the pandemic introduction (2019). I was not prepared for this new landscape but had to jump into action and react (iterate) within the new isolated remote filmmaking landscape. As a result, I directed remotely, which has essentially become a recognized new format discovered by the worldwide pandemic emergence. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Initially, there was a transition from I-Search (Ethnographic) to WeSearch when you began this course.  Similar to what caused me to change course and find a viable way to complete my film isolated, but dramatically changed toward the use of WeSearch with the accessibility of Zoom with subjects from all over the world to share their stories. As a result, I turned to research and subjects filmed far away to present a feeling of defined story association closer to any previous film direction I had traditionally completed. Subjects' lives were right there in front of me, in the comfort of their environments surrounding them. And even though it was captured digitally within the small frame of a Zoom interactive camera view, it brought people and their stories together to create a greater impact on the film and research-documented.\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "Now, I'm not saying this discovery was the original, but it was explored at the moment with less guidance and allowed for research and filmmaking to come together as one by taking on a challenge with help similar to I-Search/WeSearch. And even though it was not attained at a traditional level, it formed an impactful experience for myself and the subjects who participated, influencing the direction of research and filmmaking welcomed even today.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "I wanted you to hear this story because challenging yourself to an elevated level brings more than impact. It brings discovery. And as you ALL move forward, I encourage you to find your voice and pursue your interests in filmmaking and research with your own perspectives with support from found documents and examples because you and your story will benefit from the journey of creating by discovery.  \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "So, this week's topic is to see if you can find any new or added components toward your research interests that have influenced yourself with film. Ask yourself, has anything evolved, or will it be the same. Research discovery and enhancement are current in the film industry today. And have the power to produce impactful after-effects toward allowance of new proponents to emerge and replace some of the traditionally used elements over the years. Once you find a topic of interest, write about what you think will influence the world from your standpoint. And ask yourself, will it enhance or bring on challenges toward your journey moving forward in your education, film, and life?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Share these perspectives on the Discussion platform within this week's module, which will enable everyone to see and feed off other perspectives. Allowing you to showcase to each other any relevant stories and perspectives discovered at any point in your film research journey and see if any have similar influences toward yours enable you to move further.\r\n",
